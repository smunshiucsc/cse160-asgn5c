<p> Grader Notes: This is my Assignment 5c, dubbed "Block Hunt" after the famous Duck
    Hunt game. Esssentially, your goal is to shoot as many cubes (diamonds are 10 points,
    gold is 30 points, and red is -50 points) and prisms (20 points), while avoiding the 
    cylinders (-20 points). The game will keep going until you hit the obsidian sphere of 
    death, which will terminate your game. Happy Hunting! (Side Note: I needed ChatGPT's help
    with the Shoot() function, particularly to determine how to detect the type of the mouse click.
    For this, I used ChatGPT for the raytracing portion of the code.)
